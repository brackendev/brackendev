* Easily unregister block-based NSNotificationCenter observers using *Resource acquisition is initialization*.

#### English readability and comprehension difficulty
* [Swift](https://github.com/brackendev/Readability-Swift) and [Objective-C](https://github.com/brackendev/Readability-Objective-C) libraries to determine readability and comprehension difficulty. (Includes CocoaPods support.)

#### iOS resolution independence examples
* [Swift](https://github.com/brackendev/iOS-Resolution-Independence-Swift) and [Objective-C](https://github.com/brackendev/iOS-Resolution-Independence-Objective-C) examples showing how to add resolution independence and future-proof iOS projects by using vector graphics.

#### [Deep clean Xcode projects](https://gist.github.com/brackendev/8327852e21ce5b7f480f72459faa277a)
